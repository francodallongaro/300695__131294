          <p class="about-description">
            My name is <span class="about-green">Cami Mostaza</span> and I'm passionate about designing creative, meaningful and impactful experience to improve people’s life.
            <br><br>
            I'm constantly looking to challenge myself to learn new skills and work with new people in multi-disciplinary teams.<br>
            I am a curious and eager-learner by nature.
            <br><br>
            Interested in designing innovative, learning &amp; nature-related projects. I’m a communicator, a storyteller and a collaborator.
            <br><br>
            I am very much a big-picture thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.<br>Currently, specializing in Ux research and interaction design.

          <p class="about-description">
            Im an <span class="about-green">Architect</span> with an honor-degree in Buenos Aires University.<br>
            I have performed as a design and technical teacher there as well. 
            <br><br>
            Moreover, Im an <span class="about-green">Expert</span> at Excellence in design for greater efficiencies (EDGE). Im very interested in green-design and climate change-related projects.
            <br><br>
            I also perform as a singer and a paintor, unleashing my interior artist.
            <br><br>
            All this background immensely enriches me in my day-to-day designer’s projects.  Outside of work you’ll usually find me taking long treks, singing or chasing my dog down the park.  Beware, a life-philosophy conversation with me could last hours. That’s just me.

            We are a constant work in progress.
            <br><br>
            I am always looking at ways to challenge and improve myself – which is why in my spare time I like to take courses, read new books and blogs, dabble in new projects and attend meetups.

            Good design is obvious.<br>
            Great design is transparent.
            <br><br>
            Simplicity and clarity lead to good design. <br>
            Stay true to yourself and stay true to others.

            We are not isolated islands, we flourish together.

            There’s nothing like being part of a team and making it grow. We have a lot to share and to learn from others.
